            <span>What is Meshi?</span>
          </h3>
          <p>
            It’s 2019, the year of on-demand everything but we’re also
            experiencing a culture shift to being more aware of where
            ingredients are sourced and what we put into our bodies. In response
            to the growing need for instant gratification, current culture shift
            and the surge of food delivery apps available to users, I explored
            creating an app focused on delivering made-to-order, healthy and
            fresh meals anytime - whether it’s on-demand, weekly or even on a
            monthly basis.
          </p>

          <h3 class="h3-icon">
            <img
              src="./images/meshi/sectiontitle/problem.svg"
              alt="Magnifying Glass Icon"
            />
            <span>The Problem</span>
          </h3>
          <p>
            I first identified the problem by recognizing that there’s a growing
            community of people who rely on food delivery apps due to time
            constraints or not being able to gracefully navigate their way
            through the kitchen. They struggle with having very little time to
            shop or cook amidst other daily commitments, so they turn to the
            convenience of getting meals delivered to them.
          </p>
          <p>
            So I wondered, how would this app help its users eat healthy in a
            more efficient way while ensuring that their meals check off the
            following buckets:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Meals are within their dietary restrictions</li>
            <li>Fresh and responsibly sourced ingredients</li>
            <li>Can turn eating healthy into a habit</li>
          </ul>

          <h3 class="h3-icon">

              src="./images/meshi/sectiontitle/solution.svg"
              alt="Lightbulb Icon"
            />
            <span>The Solution</span>
          </h3>
          <p>
            The solution is to allow Meshi to be ultra personalized and provide
            transparency for its users but also, allow individuals to find what
            they can eat easily rather than have them comb through the app.
            Also, take a UX approach to differentiate Meshi’s user experience to
            make it an app that’s less likely to be replicated and serve most
            benefit to its users.

            <span>User Survey</span>
          </h3>
          <p>
            In order to create a healthy meal delivery app that would cater to
            my users, I sought answers to the following questions:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>What were their current dining patterns?</li>
            <li>What are their main reasons for ordering delivery?</li>
            <li>How easy is their current process in ordering delivery?</li>
            <li>
              What were their likes and frustrations with their current food
              delivery app?
            </li>
            <li>Have they ever tried meal prepping?</li>
            <li>
              Why did they stop meal prepping (or what would push them to stop)?
            </li>
          </ul>

            </div>
          </div>

          <p>
            My initial assumptions proved to be incredibly wrong. I went into
            the project thinking that users were looking to save time, use an
            app that resembles current ones but with bigger photos and filters
            to help with discoverability of meals within a dietary restriction
            and a service that offered structured and simple meal plans.
          </p>

          <p>
            After research, I saw that users are looking for the ability to view
            healthy meals but customize it to their liking, have access to the
            meals on the day they need it. If on a meal plan, they want
            personalized meal plans to fit their need and schedule. Last but not
            the least, they also want transparency with how meals are made,
            where ingredients are sourced and environmentally friendly
            packaging.
          </p>

            <span>Competitive Analysis</span>
          </h3>
          <p>
            Currently, there are a lot of delivery apps in the market including
            very well-known companies like UberEats, GrubHub and Amazon. Many
            tend to wonder why consumers need many apps to do the exact same
            thing. The answer is pretty simple - it’s because the food delivery
            market is growing fast and competitors have plenty of business to
            gain. According to Second Measure, overall food delivery sales grew
            51% and there’s no customer loyalty between different apps since
            users migrate from one app to another.
          </p>

          <p>
            It was important to look into what current competitors in the
            healthy food delivery realm were doing in order to build a product
            that would be different from what is currently offered.

          <br />
          <p>
            Mixt uses ingredients are locally sourced which helps small
            businesses and gives back to the community but, they currently
            operate in brick and mortar stores and work with third party app
            partners to fulfill deliveries. They also have a limited menu that
            doesn’t allow customers to fully customize their meals.
          </p>

          <br />
          <p>
            Territory Foods is a meal prep delivery service that doesn’t limit
            access to their food through delivery only. They also give their
            users the option to pick up meals from partner locations and gyms.
            However, delivery/pick up is available twice a week which doesn’t
            scream fresh & high-quality. Also, customers are kept in the dark as
            to where and when meals are made which lessens transparency - one of
            the core values of the company.

          <br />
          <p>
            Sakara offers a fully plant based menu that can’t be customized
            since they only offer set menus for the week which are released a
            week before. They have simple meal plan options that takes less than
            5 mins to sign up for. However, convenience comes at a price since
            users can only select between 3 or 5 day plans and can’t cancel
            immediately. Lastly, all ordering is done through their website with
            no app available which could be an inconvenience for their users.

            After research, it was time to identify who Meshi's target audience
            would be. But how? Enter Aleyne, Lizzie and Richard, three vastly
            different personas to embody the full range of Meshi’s users that I
            could refer back to whenever I need to validate my decisions.

            backed by data from research.

          <p>
            I turned to sketching simple wireframes which, as always, allowed me
            to explore ideas quickly and efficiently prior to moving on to
            high-fidelity wireframes.

          <p>
            These sketches were then translated to wireframes using Figma. Since
            I wanted users to get a good idea of what the app had to offer
            through onboarding screens, I also decided to test onboarding and
            signing up for an account through Maze to ensure that it would be an
            informative and smooth process.

            , I was able to uncover the following things and quickly revise my
            wireframes:
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong
              >1. Users wanted an option to skip the onboarding screens:</strong
            >
            I had made a mistake in thinking that customers would better
            understand an app by reading all onboarding screens but didn’t
            realize that some wouldn’t have time to read or, would rather learn
            what’s in an app by actually using it.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong
              >2. Interested in seeing the contents of the app prior to signing
              up for an account:</strong
            >
            A bigger oops on my part - after this was brought up, I revisited
            Apple Guidelines and saw that it’s always better to allow guest
            access so that users can explore an app before committing to it by
            signing up.

          <p>
            I finally narrowed down 3 options for an app name: Meshi, MealBox
            and Green & Grain after a mind mapping session and ultimately
            decided to go with “Meshi” which also means food in Japanese. My
            memories of growing up in Japan usually have food included - the
            Japanese are known for portion control (hence the bento craze) as
            well as eating a well balanced and healthy meal. All of which were
            synonymous to what this app wants to provide to its users.

          </div>
          <p>
            With food, there seems to be endless possibilities with color
            combinations. I wanted to keep the focus on healthy food - reds,
            oranges, yellows and a ton of greens. To avoid eye strain, I kept
            Japanese influence in mind by incorporating muted and neutral colors
            so it’d be easy to look at when used in design.

          />
          <p>
            I chose to keep typography style simple in order to set good visual
            hierarchy. The contrast between Kollektif and Cooper Hewitt was a
            great way to provide users with clarity when reading through screens
            in the app.

          <p>
            To complete the branding process, I compiled a style guide for Meshi
            to help explain how to use the logo, which fonts and colors to use
            and shows preferred elements when making design choices.

            With branding work done, it was time to tie this into my existing

            to put it through a series of tests. <br />
          </p>

            First came two design decisions that I needed major help with, and

            Screen #2 had won with 70% of the participants favoring the bright
            burnt orange color that matched the icons that served for filtering
            on the top of the screen. The other screens scored 15% each. I
            decided to listen to my test participants since the design felt
            cohesive and orange seemed perfect for a call to action button.

            Screen 1 scored 26%, screen 2 came in at 39% and screen 3 was
            favored by 35% of the test participants. Ultimately, I decided to go
            with screen 2 which was chosen by many but updated it’s call to
            action button to the same burnt orange color to keep everything
            consistent.

            participants to complete the following tasks:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Read all onboarding screens and access app. Once app access is
              granted, add "Vegan Tofu Red Curry" to your cart to enter sign up
              process
            </li>
            <li>
              Complete sign up process, and continue to purchase "Vegan Tofu Red
              Curry"
            </li>
            <li>
              Go to "Personalized Meals" and purchase "Chile Colorado with
              Quinoa Pilaf and Roasted Veggies" as sides

          <p>
            All test participants completed tasks with ease and stated that the
            app was easy to use and intuitive but pointed out a few design and
            process flaws which were revised accordingly.

            <strong>1. Meal Plan Subscription Process:</strong> Participants had
            mentioned how limited the meal plan subscription process felt and
            that options felt very restricted.

          <p>
            To address this, I implemented dropdown lists and a calendar rather
            than having the user enter a start date. By doing so, it would
            provide more personalization and clarity for the user as to when
            their meal plan would begin, which days it’d be delivered and what
            time each day.

            <strong>2. Meal Plan Review Screens:</strong> Users wanted more
            detail in the meal plan review screens and noticed a typo. I updated
            the design by adding more detail to the meal plan review screens
            which would help set better customer expectations.

            <strong>3. Adding Payment Information Screens:</strong> This flaw
            turned out to be the biggest mistake that I made. One test
            participant was able to point out was that I missed creating screens
            that prompted users to add their payment information. With the help
            of Apple Guidelines, I incorporated this step during the first time
            a user completes their purchase.
          </p>

          <div class="block-images">
            <div>
              <img src="./images/meshi/payment1.png" alt="Payment Screen 1" />

            <strong>4. Account Update Acknowledgement:</strong> Test
            participants also wanted acknowledgement of any account updates
            they’ve saved rather than just returning to the profile screen which
            was another oops moment for me. My initial design failed to
            acknowledge user action and was glad that this suggestion was
            brought up. A quick pop up was added to eliminate user confusion.

          <p>
            After applying changes to the design to significantly improve
            Meshi’s usability, I still found myself not feeling 100% satisfied.
            I gathered more feedback from my mentors as well as test
            participants to find things I could improve.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>1. Alignment Issues:</strong> Previously, meal names on the
            left column were too close to the end of the screen and required
            more white space. In order to adhere to the margin requirement, I
            fixed text width of meal names and added more space.

              <span class="caption">After</span>

          </div>

          <p>
            <strong>2. Creating an inVision Prototype:</strong> My initial
            prototype was created in Figma since inVision didn’t support
            horizontal scrolling which was a part of my design (dietary
            restriction filters located on the top of the screen). I
            successfully found a work around to this issue by creating separate
            images to simulate the horizontal scroll.
          </p>

          <p>
            You can find my old Figma prototype
            <span class="hover-link"
              ><a href="http://bit.ly/2pMnH5t" target="_blank">here</a></span

            >.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>3. Landing Page Animation:</strong> The landing page of my
            initial prototype depended solely on smart animations available on
            Figma. I turned to Principle to animate this page and incorporated
            it into the inVision prototype.

            <strong>4. Microinteractions:</strong> My mentor,
            <span class="hover-link"
              ><a href="http://mikedekker.com" target="_blank"
                >Mike Dekker</a
              ></span
            >
            had brought up that microinteractions would be a great way to refine
            an app and suggested that I do research on it. My first thought was
            that microinteractions existed to make an app seem more playful and
            fun but after research, I see that improves the user experience
            since it communicates the brand and encourages engagement.
          </p>

          <p>
            It’s also an easy way to acknowledge the user’s action in the app
            which was something I had lacked prior to usability testing. I
            applied microinteractions to these parts of the app:
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>a. Add to cart for built & personalized meals</strong>
          </p>

          <p>
            Previously, users would click add to cart and it would lead them to
            the next screen immediately without any acknowledgement:
          </p>

          <div class="block-images">
            <div>
              <img
                class="ios-screen-resolution"
                src="./images/meshi/addtocart.png"
                alt="Add to cart screen 1"
              />
            </div>
            <div>
              <img
                class="ios-screen-resolution"
                src="./images/meshi/addtocart2.png"
                alt="Add to cart screen 2"
              />
            </div>
          </div>

          <p>
            This step was improved by adding microinteraction so that users are
            aware that they’ve added a meal into their cart prior to moving on
            to the next screen:
          </p>

          <div class="block-images center">
            <div>
              <img
                class="ios-device-resolution"
                src="./images/meshi/addtocart-microinteraction.gif"
                alt="Add to cart microinteraction"
              />
            </div>
          </div>

          <p>
            <strong>b. Account update</strong>
          </p>

          <p>
            In the previous version, a simple notification would pop up to alert
            the user that their information has been updated:
          </p>

          <div class="block-images center">
            <div>
              <img
                class="ios-screen-resolution"
                src="./images/meshi/acknowledgement1.png"
                alt="User Acknowledgement"
              />
            </div>
          </div>

          <p>
            Just like the add to cart function, another microinteraction has
            been added here as well:
          </p>

          <div class="block-images center">
            <div>
              <img
                class="ios-device-resolution"
                src="./images/meshi/acknowledgementmicrointeraction.gif"
                alt="User Acknowledgment microinteraction"
              />

          </h3>
          <p>
            Food delivery isn’t the new kid around the block anymore - it’s a
            heavily saturated market that gets even more crowded and competitive
            as years go by. The biggest lesson I’ve learned during this project
            was to:
          </p>

          <p></p>

          <ol>
            <li>
              Research and dig deep into current user frustrations
            </li>
            <li>
              Listen to customer wants and “dream” features are
            </li>
            <li>
              Identify what would increase customer loyalty while following your
              process
            </li>
          </ol>

          <p>
            During the research and discovery phase of the project, I was able
            to unearth likes and frustrations that users had with their current
            preferred app, but I didn’t know the right questions to ask to find
            out more about the frustrations they were facing as well as what
            features an app would need for them to be loyal to it.
          </p>

          <p>
            In addition to this, although I was able to follow my process, I
            know that I designed my wireframes and mockups so quickly that I
            forgot to take a step back to revisit my user flows more than once
            to dot my i’s and cross my t’s. This ultimately led to some missing
            screens for important processes and acknowledgement of user action.
          </p>

          <h3 class="h3-icon">
            <img
              src="./images/meshi/sectiontitle/moretime.svg"
              alt="Clock Icon"
            />
            <span>If I Had More Time...</span>
          </h3>
          <p>
            If I had more time, I would’ve spent it more on user interviews to
            find out more features that users want out of their food delivery
            and meal planning apps. I’d also continuously look back on all the
            data I’ve accumulated to ensure that I don’t overlook anything.
          </p>

          <p>
            This project was definitely an eye opening experience but as they
            all say, you have to make mistakes in order to learn.
          </p>
