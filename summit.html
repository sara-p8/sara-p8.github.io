            This project was done during Startup Weekend South Central organized
            by Techstars in partnership with Google for Entrepreneurs. It was a
            54-hour event, where participants pitched ideas, formed teams and
            solved a specific real-world problem through rapid prototyping and
            design thinking.

            <span>What is Summit?</span>
          </h3>
          <p>
            People don’t consume news the way they used to. There’s a reason
            people say that the newspaper is a dying art form. Journalists have
            also formed opinions no matter how much they try to stay objective
            and everyone has a surplus of platforms to get their news from. Our
            team explored how we could offer users with summarized articles so
            that they can stay at the peak of news that they care about.
          </p>

            <span>The Problem</span>
          </h3>
          <p>
            The majority of the population are tired of having to get their news
            from several different platforms that all share the same flaws:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              News apps are clunky and messy to navigate
            </li>
            <li>
              Reading lengthy articles and having to scour different sources
              is time-consuming
            </li>
            <li>
              Articles tend to be biased and can even be fake at times
            </li>
          </ul>
          </p>

            <span>The Solution</span>
          </h3>
          <p>
            Summit wants to create the best user experience for mobile news by
            offering the following:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Curating news feeds according to user interest
            </li>
            <li>
              Utilizing artificial intelligence to summarize and remove bias from
              news articles
            </li>
            <li>
              Allow users to pick up from where they left off and avoid
              showing articles that they've already read
            </li>
          </ul>

          </h3>
          <p>
            Note: Due to the nature of the hackathon event, we had to be
            resourceful and work with limited information.
          </p>
          <p>
            Despite time constraints, we knew the best course of action to
            validate our problem and determine goals for our MVP would come from
            user research. That being said, we asked hackathon participants and
            our social media contacts to respond to our user survey. Some of the
            questions asked were:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>What’s your main source for news?</li>
            <li>What features do you like/dislike about your news app? </li>
            <li>How much time do you spend on finding news/reading articles?</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
              We found this particular information interesting and helpful:

                <span>
                  Find articles too lengthy and time consuming to read
                </span>
              </div>
              <div class="col">

                <span>

          <p>
            After conducting the user survey, we were able to confirm that we
            shared the same frustrations as others but we hadn’t realized that
            our users were able to get the jist of an article from headlines and
            images as well. The results and feedback received in the survey gave
            us information we needed to build Summit within a short period of time.

          <p>
            We took time to scope out the competition to see what they were
            doing right and of course, what they were doing wrong. Strengths lied
            in the fact that our competition had updated articles and good
            imagery however, the length of the article and relevance to the
            user was lacking.
          </p>
          <p>
            For Summit to be successful, we knew that we had to offer our users
            a way to consume news that they cared for in a short amount of time
            and without bias. The basic who, what, where, when and how would keep
            our users updated and give them the ability to form their own opinions
            as well.

            <span>High-fidelity Mockups</span>
          </h3>

          <p>
            After going through our paper prototypes with a technical coach, our
            team worked on creating high-fidelity mockups. Here’s a sample of our
            design:

            The last step for South Central Startup Weekend was to pitch our idea
            to the jury comprised of Aaron Saunders (founder of <a href="https://www.in3dc.com/"
            target="_blank">Inclusive Innovation Incubator</a>), Austin Clements
            (partner at <a href="http://opv.la/" target="_blank">OPV</a>), DeMarcus
            Williams (Director at <a href="https://svb.com" target="_blank">Silicon
            Valley Bank</a>), Kyle Miller (Product at <a href="https://tinder.com" target="_blank">Tinder</a>)
            and Qiana Patterson (Vice President of Strategic
            Development at <a href="https://www.hopskipdrive.com/" target="_blank">HopSkipDrive</a>).
          </p>
          <p>
            In our presentation, we discussed why there’s a need for our product
            and how it would gain revenue. In addition to this, we also explained
            the tech plan to train and perfect Artificial Intelligence for
            Summit News.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our hard work paid off and our team won third place!

            <span>What I Learned</span>
          </h3>
          <p>
            This was my first hackathon and I was very anxious going into it.
            Walking away from it now, I realize that this was one of the most
            thrilling experiences I’ve ever had in my life.
          </p>
          <p>
            My biggest challenge was convincing my teammates that we needed to
            research in order for us to create a product with intention and
            identify the scope of our project. In addition to this, I was able
            to fully utilize the skills I’ve honed from being a Customer
            Experience Lead and the skills I acquired from my UX Design program
            through <a href="https://bloc.io" target="_blank">Bloc</a> to
            empathize with not just our potential users, but with my teammates as
            well. This helped me become the ultimate team player by being open
            to feedback from my teammates and technical coaches but also be able
            to offer my ideas and constructive critique as well.
          </p>
          <p>
            Last lesson learned: Hackathons are fun! Despite the time crunch and
            high-pressure environment, it was such an incredible 54 hours and I
            can’t wait to participate in more!
          </p>

          <h3 class="h3-icon">
            <img
              src="./images/meshi/sectiontitle/moretime.svg"
              alt="Clock Icon"
            />
            <span>If I Had More Time...</span>
          </h3>
          <p>
            I’ve had a bit of time (and leftover adrenaline rush) post-hackathon so I was
            able to improve the onboarding process from when we initially built
            our prototype which you can view <a href="https://www.figma.com/proto/iGiL2Pfp581myPzXYDWu9t/Hackathon-Summit-Workspace?node-id=45%3A18&viewport=-136%2C817%2C0.13491643965244293&scaling=scale-down" target="_blank">here</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            If we did have more time however, I’d love to deep dive into research
            and spend more time on testing and iterating our product. In addition
            to this, finding ways to convert free customers to paying ones and
            mapping out the flow of this would also be a great addition to make
            the prototype more realistic.
