          </h3>
          <p>
            With so many bus stations, different routes and times being added or
            changed, it’s hard to keep track of which bus you should take and
            figure out the fastest way to basically anywhere. The app’s main
            priority is to provide as much information in a simple and intuitive
            platform.
          </p>

          <h3 class="h3-icon">
            <img src="./images/meshi/sectiontitle/problem.svg" alt="Magnifying Glass Icon" />
            <span>The Problem</span>
          </h3>
          <p>
            An increasing number of bus routes have been recently added and many
            of those routes stop at the same bus stop. Commuters want to know
            what the next arriving bus is and how long it’d take them to get to
            the bus stop since simply rushing to the stop when they see a bus no
            longer works since it may not even be the bus that they are expecting.
          </p>
          <p>
            Most complaints received is for the bus stop at Washington and State
            which currently have 7 bus lines serving the stop.
          </p>

            To design a mobile app that displays important information for the
            Washington & State bus stop which includes the following:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Which bus routes service the stop
            </li>
            <li>
              How many minutes until the bus arrives

            A user survey was conducted to understand the needs of commuters as
            well as discover their motivations and frustrations with current apps
            they were using. The following questions were answered from the survey

           <li>How many times did survey participants take the bus? </li>
           <li>What devices do they use when looking up bus information?</li>
           <li>What was their go-to app when planning their commute?</li>
           <li>Which features do they like or dislike about their current app?</li>
           <li>What kind of information/feature did they wish their current app offered?</li>

          <p>
            After conducting the user survey, I was able to confirm that a lot
            of my assumptions were correct but I hadn’t realized that directions
            to the nearest bus stops and the ability to track the location of
            buses in real time was considered as an important feature for bus
            riders. The results and feedback received in the survey gave me more
            insight to confidently move forward with bringing BusyBus to life.

          </h3>
          <p>
            My biggest takeaway from conducting the user survey was seeing that
            bus riders weren’t absolutely happy with their current public transit
            app since all their travel needs weren’t being met. I looked into
            major players of the public transit market to find out how BusyBus
            could enter the market.
          </p>

          <p>
            It was important to look into what current competitors in the healthy
            food delivery realm were doing in order to build a product that would
            be different from what is currently offered.

          <div id="storage">
            <img src="./images/busybus/googlemaps.png" alt="Google Maps Logo" />
          </div>
          <br />
          <p>
            Google Maps was the leading app that my user participants used for
            planning their trips and it made complete sense. They offered public
            transit data that offered directions both in and out of metropolitan
            areas and gave users the ability to download maps for offline use.
            However, they lacked in providing real time public transit
            information and walking navigation directions can sometimes be
            inaccurate.
          </p>

          <div id="storage">
            <img src="./images/busybus/moovit.png" alt="Moovit Logo" />
          </div>
          <br />
          <p>
            Moovit on the other hand positions themselves as “the Wikipedia of
            Transit.” It’s a community-driven app hence, giving its users
            access to real time transit data. However, Moovit’s limited for
            those who need driving directions or public transit information
            in suburbs where transit options are limited. Also, the app doesn’t
            allow their users to manually update their route while in progress.
          </p>

          <p>
            For BusyBus to successfully gain traction as a new competitor in the
            market, it’s advisable to include features and strengths of major
            players that’s beneficial to the user but also incorporate what
            riders are looking for: real time updates and alerts.
          </p>

          <p>
            In addition to this, truly understanding how an individual user plans
            their trips and which routes they frequent will make the app a
            regular go-to rather than something they use when they remember
            or need it. Keeping tabs on bus stops the user frequently goes
            to will help with offering better solutions for the user.
          </p>

          <p>
            Last but not the least, providing accurate transit data will benefit
            users. By removing limitations and barriers that other apps have
            will help attract and add to BusyBus’ customer base.

            With my user stories selected and prioritized, I turned to pen and

            should look.

            Test participants were able to provide me with incredibly helpful
            feedback. Upon first glance, participants found the app easy to figure
            out and were able to assume that it was a map app for buses and that
            it could help with getting travel directions. It was also mentioned
            that the interface was simple and straightforward.

          heart icon which was placed so that users could “like” a route. In
          addition to this, they felt that all icons should be labeled since
          it would help users gain familiarity of where each feature is located.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>2. Exit Button:</strong>
            All testers had commented that the position of the exit button in
            the last screen threw them off since it was inconsistent from the
            first two screens they saw. In addition to placement, they also
            suggested making it bigger so that it was more visible.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>3. Colors on the sketches:</strong>
            Testers were confused with what the colors in the sketches meant. I
            later on realized that I shouldn’t have used any color on my paper
            prototype so that they wouldn’t feel distracted or lose focus on
            the goal for testing.

          </h3>
          <p>
            Keeping in mind all the feedback I received on my sketches, I
            proceeded to creating a high fidelity mockup for the bus stop
            screen.
          </p>

          </div>

          <p>
            1st Iteration 2nd Iteration Final Version
          </p>

          <h3>1st Iteration</h3>
          <p>
            My initial design was... let’s just say it was an “okay” try. I had
            completely ignored Apple Guidelines and made a bunch of rookie mistakes.
            I was still in the “as long as it looks cute” designer phase rather
            than focused on usability.  Design flaws that needed to be corrected
            in this version were:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              I needed to add a title bar to the screen which indicated the
              location of the bus rider
            </li>
            <li>
              Search field needed to be moved up top per Apple Guidelines and
              user familiarity
            </li>
            <li>
              Contrast between nav bar icons and background didn’t meet
              accessibility guidelines.
            </li>
            <li>
              An arrow needed to be added to the end of bus line information to
              indicate that there’s more information available if tapped on.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>2nd Iteration</h3>
          <p>
            The second version was better since I added the title bar and
            search field on the top part of the screen and an arrow after
            bus information to avoid any user confusion. In addition to this,
            the contrast issue in the nav bar was addressed by using a darker
            shade as a background. I also introduced a new color to the active
            icon to show the user that they were on that current page within
            BusyBus. However, I still had a few more issues that I needed to
            address.
          </p>
          <p>
            Design flaws that needed to be corrected in this version were:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Font size used was incredibly small and didn’t meet accessibility
              guidelines
            </li>
            <li>
              Icons in the map were too small and not readable. Again, another
              accessibility issue
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Final Version</h3>
          <p>
            My final version had addressed all accessibility issues in terms of
            readability and color. This version was a solution to the current
            problem of riders because of the following reasons:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              Users are able to easily view the location of the next arriving bus
              that’s within their vicinity on their screen. Bus locations are also
              properly labeled with their line number so users are never confused
              as to which direction their bus is coming from
            </li>
            <li>
              Hierarchy is applied to easily see which bus line arrives in a set
              amount of time. Green reflects that a bus is arriving in under 5
              minutes, Yellow are for those arriving in less than 10 minutes and
              buses arriving in more than 10 minutes are in red.
            </li>
            <li>
              Users have access to seeing all lines arriving at the bus stop of
              their choice after selecting the bus stop nearest to them (or of
              their choice). Directions would also appear along with how long it
              would take for the user to walk to the bus stop.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            For added ease of navigation and use, a navigation bar below also
            allows the user to access the map view (bus stop display screen),
            save trips they frequently take, view previous trips, plan future
            trips and explore what’s around their current location.
          </p>

            Once I was 100% happy with my visual design, I utilized my HTML and
            CSS skills to build the bus routes screen for BusyBus and deployed
            the project to Github.

            <span>What I Learned</span>
          </h3>
          <p>
            This was my first UX project and although it was small and had one
            specific use, I learned that no project is too small to truly
            understand the needs of potential users and go through the entire
            UX process.
          <p>

          <p>
            Accessibility was also my biggest lesson here. After creating
            different versions, I learned that sizing and color is incredibly
            important to creating a design that feels inclusive for all types
            of users.
          </p>

          <p>
            I built a relationship with Apple Guidelines and learned that
            referring to it wouldn’t just help improve my design but also
            make coding the solution 10 times easier. As a new designer, it’s
            tempting to stray from the norm. However, I realized that Apple
            Guidelines (or any other guidelines) exist for a reason. It makes
            my designs familiar to users and consistency is key to creating
            something that doesn’t make my users have to think.
          </p>

          <h3 class="h3-icon">
            <img src="./images/meshi/sectiontitle/moretime.svg" alt="Clock Icon" />
            <span>If I Had More Time...</span>
          </h3>
          <p>
            If I had more time, I’d conduct usability testing of the final
            prototype and tweak accordingly. I’d also develop an Android design
            and prototype to widen BusyBus’ user base.
          </p>

          <p>
            I would’ve also loved to create a brand guideline for BusyBus and
            more pages to make the prototype more engaging and realistic.
