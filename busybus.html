            <span>What is Bus App?</span>
          </h3>
          <p>
            With so many bus stations, different routes and times being added or
            changed, it’s hard to keep track of which bus you should take and
            figure out the fastest way to basically anywhere. The app’s main
            priority is to provide as much information in a simple and intuitive
            platform.
          </p>

          <h3 class="h3-icon">

            />
            <span>The Problem</span>
          </h3>
          <p>
            An increasing number of bus routes have been recently added and many
            of those routes stop at the same bus stop. Commuters want to know
            what the next arriving bus is and how long it’d take them to get to
            the bus stop since simply rushing to the stop when they see a bus no
            longer works since it may not even be the bus that they are
            expecting.
          </p>
          <p>
            Most complaints received is for the bus stop at Washington and State
            which currently have 7 bus lines serving the stop.
          </p>

          <p>
            To design a mobile app that displays important information for the
            Washington & State bus stop which includes the following:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Which bus routes service the stop
            </li>
            <li>
              How many minutes until the bus arrives

            A user survey was conducted to understand the needs of commuters as

            apps they were using. The following questions were answered from the
            survey that was held:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>How many times did survey participants take the bus?</li>
            <li>What devices do they use when looking up bus information?</li>

          <p>
            After conducting the user survey, I was able to confirm that a lot
            of my assumptions were correct but I hadn’t realized that directions
            to the nearest bus stops and the ability to track the location of
            buses in real time was considered as an important feature for bus
            riders. The results and feedback received in the survey gave me more
            insight to confidently move forward with bringing Bus App to life.

          </h3>
          <p>
            My biggest takeaway from conducting the user survey was seeing that
            bus riders weren’t absolutely happy with their current public
            transit app since all their travel needs weren’t being met. I looked
            into major players of the public transit market to find out how
            Bus App could enter the market.
          </p>

          <p>
            It was important to look into what current competitors in the
            healthy food delivery realm were doing in order to build a product
            that would be different from what is currently offered.
          </p>

          <br />
          <p>
            Google Maps was the leading app that my user participants used for
            planning their trips and it made complete sense. They offered public
            transit data that offered directions both in and out of metropolitan
            areas and gave users the ability to download maps for offline use.
            However, they lacked in providing real time public transit
            information and walking navigation directions can sometimes be
            inaccurate.
          </p>

          <div id="storage">
            <img
              style="width: auto; height: 144px;"
              src="./images/busybus/moovit.png"
              alt="Moovit Logo"
            />
          </div>
          <br />
          <p>
            Moovit on the other hand positions themselves as “the Wikipedia of
            Transit.” It’s a community-driven app hence, giving its users access
            to real time transit data. However, Moovit’s limited for those who
            need driving directions or public transit information in suburbs
            where transit options are limited. Also, the app doesn’t allow their
            users to manually update their route while in progress.
          </p>

          <p>
            For Bus App to successfully gain traction as a new competitor in the
            market, it’s advisable to include features and strengths of major
            players that’s beneficial to the user but also incorporate what
            riders are looking for: real time updates and alerts.
          </p>

          <p>
            In addition to this, truly understanding how an individual user
            plans their trips and which routes they frequent will make the app a
            regular go-to rather than something they use when they remember or
            need it. Keeping tabs on bus stops the user frequently goes to will
            help with offering better solutions for the user.
          </p>

          <p>
            Last but not the least, providing accurate transit data will benefit
            users. By removing limitations and barriers that other apps have
            will help attract and add to Bus App’ customer base.

          <p>
            With my user stories selected and prioritized, I turned to pen and
            paper to quickly sketch a 3-screen paper prototype so that I could
            map out which features I wanted in each screen and how the layout
            should look.

          />
          <p>
            After creating my sketches, I created a clickable prototype using
            Marvel so that I could test my design decisions and receive feedback
            from test participants.

            <span>Usability Testing</span>
          </h3>
          <p>
            Test participants were able to provide me with incredibly helpful
            feedback. Upon first glance, participants found the app easy to
            figure out and were able to assume that it was a map app for buses
            and that it could help with getting travel directions. It was also
            mentioned that the interface was simple and straightforward.
          </p>
          <img

            alt="Testing Session Photo"
          />
          <p>
            Despite ease of use and being intuitive, test participants had also
            pointed out design flaws that needed to be addressed:
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>1. Heart Icon and other nav bar icons:</strong> Testers were
            confused with the heart icon which was placed so that users could
            “like” a route. In addition to this, they felt that all icons should
            be labeled since it would help users gain familiarity of where each
            feature is located.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>2. Exit Button:</strong>
            All testers had commented that the position of the exit button in
            the last screen threw them off since it was inconsistent from the
            first two screens they saw. In addition to placement, they also
            suggested making it bigger so that it was more visible.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>3. Colors on the sketches:</strong>
            Testers were confused with what the colors in the sketches meant. I
            later on realized that I shouldn’t have used any color on my paper
            prototype so that they wouldn’t feel distracted or lose focus on the
            goal for testing.
          </p>

            alt="1st iteration"
          />
          <h3 class="h3-icon">1st Iteration</h3>
          <p>
            My initial design was... let’s just say it was an “okay” try. I had
            completely ignored Apple Guidelines and made a bunch of rookie
            mistakes. I was still in the “as long as it looks cute” designer
            phase rather than focused on usability.   Design flaws that needed
            to be corrected in this version were:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              I needed to add a title bar to the screen which indicated the
              location of the bus rider
            </li>
            <li>
              Search field needed to be moved up top per Apple Guidelines and
              user familiarity
            </li>
            <li>
              Contrast between nav bar icons and background didn’t meet
              accessibility guidelines.
            </li>
            <li>
              An arrow needed to be added to the end of bus line information to
              indicate that there’s more information available if tapped on.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <img
            class="version-img"
            mobile
            style="margin-bottom: -40px; max-height: 650px; width: auto; display: block; margin: 0 auto; max-width: 100%;"
            src="./images/busybus/busstop2.png"
            alt="2nd iteration"
          />
          <h3 class="h3-icon">2nd Iteration</h3>
          <p>
            The second version was better since I added the title bar and search
            field on the top part of the screen and an arrow after bus
            information to avoid any user confusion. In addition to this, the
            contrast issue in the nav bar was addressed by using a darker shade
            as a background. I also introduced a new color to the active icon to
            show the user that they were on that current page within Bus App.
            However, I still had a few more issues that I needed to address.
          </p>
          <p>
            Design flaws that needed to be corrected in this version were:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Font size used was incredibly small and didn’t meet accessibility
              guidelines
            </li>
            <li>
              Icons in the map were too small and not readable. Again, another
              accessibility issue
            </li>
          </ul>

          <img
            class="version-img"
            mobile
            style="margin-bottom: -40px; max-height: 650px; width: auto; display: block; margin: 0 auto; max-width: 100%;"
            src="./images/busybus/busstop1.png"
            alt="Final version"
          />
          <h3 class="h3-icon">Final Version</h3>
          <p>
            My final version had addressed all accessibility issues in terms of
            readability and color. This version was a solution to the current
            problem of riders because of the following reasons:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              Users are able to easily view the location of the next arriving
              bus that’s within their vicinity on their screen. Bus locations
              are also properly labeled with their line number so users are
              never confused as to which direction their bus is coming from
            </li>
            <li>
              Hierarchy is applied to easily see which bus line arrives in a set
              amount of time. Green reflects that a bus is arriving in under 5
              minutes, Yellow are for those arriving in less than 10 minutes and
              buses arriving in more than 10 minutes are in red.
            </li>
            <li>
              Users have access to seeing all lines arriving at the bus stop of
              their choice after selecting the bus stop nearest to them (or of
              their choice). Directions would also appear along with how long it
              would take for the user to walk to the bus stop.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            For added ease of navigation and use, a navigation bar below also
            allows the user to access the map view (bus stop display screen),
            save trips they frequently take, view previous trips, plan future
            trips and explore what’s around their current location.
          </p>

            <span>What I Learned</span>
          </h3>
          <p>
            This was my first UX project and although it was small and had one
            specific use, I learned that no project is too small to truly
            understand the needs of potential users and go through the entire UX
            process.
          </p>

          <p></p>

          <p>
            Accessibility was also my biggest lesson here. After creating
            different versions, I learned that sizing and color is incredibly
            important to creating a design that feels inclusive for all types of
            users.
          </p>

          <p>
            I built a relationship with Apple Guidelines and learned that
            referring to it wouldn’t just help improve my design but also make
            coding the solution 10 times easier. As a new designer, it’s
            tempting to stray from the norm. However, I realized that Apple
            Guidelines (or any other guidelines) exist for a reason. It makes my
            designs familiar to users and consistency is key to creating
            something that doesn’t make my users have to think.
          </p>

          <h3 class="h3-icon">
            <img
              src="./images/meshi/sectiontitle/moretime.svg"
              alt="Clock Icon"
            />
            <span>If I Had More Time...</span>
          </h3>
          <p>
            If I had more time, I’d conduct usability testing of the final
            prototype and tweak accordingly. I’d also develop an Android design
            and prototype to widen Bus App's user base.
          </p>

          <p>
            I would’ve also loved to create a brand guideline for Bus App and
            more pages to make the prototype more engaging and realistic.
