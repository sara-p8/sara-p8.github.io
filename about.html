          <p>
            Growing up, I always knew I was passionate about design. I started
            by designing cheerleading uniforms and party invitations. By 2003, I
            started creating Blogspot and Xanga layouts for myself and anyone
            who wanted to customize their blog.
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            In 2006, I entered college and studied Political Science and put
            design on the back burner. I learned two important lessons which
            would later on prove to be helpful in my career:
          </p>

          <section class="lessons" style="position: relative">
            <ol>
              <li>People will always have different opinions</li>
              <li>Empathy is important when crafting solutions for problems</li>
            </ol>
            <div class="down-border"></div>
          </section>

          <p>
            After college, I moved to the United States and grew to become a
            strong user advocate in Customer Success & Experience for
            early-stage startups. I built teams, created customer journey maps
            and analyzed customer data to improve products. But the most
            exciting part of my role was participating in dogfooding sessions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Dogfooding sessions made me realize the importance of design. We had
            to test the product to ensure that it was intuitive and made sense
            for our users. These sessions took me back to when I was a little
            girl taking vacations abroad with my family. No matter where I was,
            I could always tell where the bathroom or restaurants were because
            of the universal signs. This is how easy our product should end up
            being. This is how design, in general, should be.
          </p>
          <p>
            This realization, coupled with my passion for design becoming
            unearthed, led me to Bloc.io's UX/UI Design Program. Using my work
            experience and lessons learned throughout my journey, I work on
            design projects that offer simple answers to complex user problems.
          </p>
          <p>
            My goal as a designer is to craft stellar experiences that aren't
            only pleasing to the eye, but also effortless and inclusive. If we
            somehow share the same goal, then let’s connect!
