            <span>What is Honeycomb?</span>
          </h3>
          <p>
            Honeycomb is a cloud storage app that provides its users with a
            seamless way to create projects and store their files. Its core
            value is giving users the ability to jumpstart their projects by
            discovering resources within the platform and categorizing their
            documents, images, links and other files in one central place.
          </p>
          <h3 class="h3-icon">
            <img src="./images/icon2.png" alt="Sign Icon" />
            <span>The Problem</span>
          </h3>
          <p>
            Current cloud storage and organization products that are available
            to users have cluttered and busy dashboards and lack resources that
            they could use throughout the process that results to users relying
            on multiple platforms. They also lack simplicity and visibility when
            users try to locate a file or attempt to organize their content.
          </p>
          <h3 class="h3-icon">
            <img src="./images/icon3.png" alt="Lightbulb Icon" />
            <span>The Solution</span>
          </h3>
          <p>
            To solve the problem at hand, Honeycomb was born from the following
            decisions:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Have a less cluttered user interface that isn’t feature laden to
              avoid distractions and lessen user confusion when navigating
              through the platform.
            </li>
            <li>
              Be a secure space to allow community sharing so others could use
              public files as a resource which minimizes the need to hop from
              one platform to another.
            </li>
            <li>
              Enable the users ability to tag and categorize their content to
              ensure that they can organize their content efficiently and
              effectively so they can find what they need, when they need it.
            </li>

            <span>User Survey</span>
          </h3>
          <p>
            User research opens the gateway to understanding why the solutions
            were carefully chosen. By getting to know the users, I was able to
            tell what their current pain points were and what they wanted out of
            a cloud storage service. Although I had formed assumptions of what I
            felt users needed, only research would give me real and concrete
            answers. I started the research process by posting a survey online
            to multiple social media platforms, email contacts and friends.
            <br /><br />Here are key highlights collected from survey data:
          </p>
          <div class="research-section">
            <div class="row">
              <div>
                <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">
                  <img
                    src="./images/DailyUsageChart.png"
                    alt="Daily usage chart"
                    style="max-width: 130px"
                  />
                </div>

                <p>95% of the survey pool use cloud storage services</p>
              </div>
              <div>
                <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">
                  <img
                    src="./images/BrandPreferenceChart.png"
                    alt="Brand preference chart"
                  />
                </div>

                <p>
                  41% favored Google Drive while Dropbox and iCloud trailed
                  behind at 20% respectively as preferred platforms.
                </p>
              </div>
            </div>
            <div class="row">
              <div class="features-chart">
                <img
                  src="./images/FeaturesChart.png"
                  alt="Features chart"
                  style="width: 100%; height: auto; max-width: 256px;"
                />
              </div>
              <div style="display: flex; align-items: center;">
                <p>
                  When asked what features they value as important in a
                  platform, 74% said they wanted upload content, 68% selected
                  the ability to view and edit files, 64% chose sharing and
                  security features and 63% wants to create content.
                </p>
              </div>
            </div>
          </div>

          <p>
            When asked about what they liked the most about their current cloud
            storage service they said:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>“It’s easy to use”</li>
            <li>“The convenience of it”</li>
            <li>“It’s free”</li>
          </ul>
          <p>As far as their dislikes were concerned, they answered:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>“Too much clutter”</li>
            <li>
              “Files are saved one after the other, so they aren't organized and
              can get lost”
            </li>
            <li>“I have to use multiple platforms to get one thing done”</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            I learned critical things that I never knew about the survey
            participants. If I hadn’t researched, I would’ve gone with my
            initial theory of users wanting newer features and a better overall
            user experience. Surprisingly, I realized that users wanted a simple
            platform that would be easy to use and act as the one central place
            where they could have access to resources, create, edit or save
            content and collaborate.

            <span>Competitive Analysis</span>
          </h3>
          <p>
            Now that I had learned more about my potential users, it was time to
            learn more about the competition. I looked into their strengths,
            weaknesses, opportunities and threats. No matter how successful
            these products were, I saw that I could still fill a pro and con
            list for all of them.
          </p>
          <br />
          <div id="storage">
            <img src="./images/DropboxLogo.png" alt="Dropbox Logo" />
            <img src="./images/GoogleDriveLogo.png" alt="Google Drive Logo" />
            <img src="./images/PinterestLogo.png" alt="Pinterest Logo" />
          </div>
          <br />
          <p>
            Dropbox’s most popular feature was their sync folder where users can
            automatically upload to the cloud and share with other devices but
            their downfall was the limited amount of free storage they offer to
            their users (2 GB) and absence of native productivity tools.
          </p>
          <p>
            Google Drive on the other hand is a powerhouse for productivity
            tools and has strong brand recognition that exudes trustworthiness
            but, since they offer so much features, content that users create or
            store end up lost and hard to locate when needed.
          </p>
          <p>
            Pinterest’s use of images are visually appealing and catches
            interest very quickly but the interface can easily feel cluttered
            and looking for a specific pinned item becomes a difficult feat due
            to many pin boards or uncategorized pins.

            To recap, here’s the list of design decisions pulled from combing
            through research data:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Address the trend of low discoverability amongst competitors by
              allowing users to categorize and tag their content
            </li>
            <li>
              Design an intuitive and minimalist interface that focuses on one
              action at a time to avoid distractions and user confusion
            </li>
            <li>
              Provide users the option to securely share their content with
              other users on the platform so they could act as a resource and
              vice versa
            </li>
            <li>
              Allow users to sign up quickly by using their email or social
              media account
            </li>
            <li>Build the MVP with a focus on showcasing important features</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            With all this information laid out, it was time to translate the

            completely different from each other, but would be the epitome of
            Honeycomb’s target user

          </h3>
          <p>
            After collecting and analyzing data and creating my personas, it was
            easier for me to compile a
            <span class="hover-link">
              <a
                href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_k-1lG6SXh0QasLPB4Vv_GaI3tj5w_cpWpjWmVZOhu0/edit?usp=sharing"

              >
            </span>
            . I ranked these stories by importance and focused on high priority
            tasks to reach the minimum viable product (MVP). These user stories
            would later on be translated into user flows to better show how the
            user would execute each task such as the example shown below:
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong
              >“As a new user, I want to create an account by signing up with my

            <span>Site Map & Content Strategy</span>
          </h3>
          <p>
            Now that I had an idea of what users were looking for in a platform
            and how I wanted them to accomplish tasks, it was time to carefully
            decide where a user would find a feature they’re looking for by
            creating a
            <span class="hover-link"
              ><a
                href="https://whimsical.com/DbhNVpayHi6PxCafmqYfXZ"
                target="_blank"
                >sitemap</a
              ></span
            >. This ultimately helped me stay true to the design decisions I
            formed after research.
          </p>

          <img src="./images/sitemap.png" alt="Sitemap Preview" />
          <p>
            <br />
            In addition to this, I had to draft what future customers would see,
            read and most importantly, feel while using Honeycomb. Crafting
            content strategy was made easier with the power of knowledge I had
            acquired from the earlier stages of research, and would help during
            the branding phase.

            <span>Sketches & Wireframes</span>
          </h3>
          <p>
            My user flows allowed me to have a better idea on how the interface
            should look. That being said, I started translating my initial ideas
            into rough sketches which allowed me to explore ideas quickly and
            efficiently.

          <img src="./images/sketches.png" alt="Sketches Preview" />
          <p>
            I used my sketches, user stories and sitemap to create
            <span class="hover-link"
              ><a
                href="https://www.figma.com/file/QqqTemKCGnDOzNeQLZI3b9zy/Cloud-Storage-Wireframes?node-id=0%3A1"

              ></span
            >
            in Figma that addressed the solution I had in mind. What was
            important to me was that users could easily find what they’re
            looking for - this is why having folders on the top and everything
            grouped into file type would make it easier for a user to locate
            what they needed, whenever they needed it.

          </h3>
          <p>
            Prior to moving on to branding and high-fidelity mockups, I needed
            to consult with users through testing to see if my design decisions
            made sense. I used inVision to conduct both remote and in-person
            usability tests and wrote a test script so that my participants knew
            what they were getting themselves into and what to look out for.

          />
          <p>
            This was an important step since I was able to receive feedback
            early on that would help me revise key action items. Here are some
            comments and suggestions received:

          <p>
            Science has already explained that it takes a lot of singular and
            group work for bees to create honeycomb and there’s a beauty towards
            the effort that bees have to put in to be able to come up with such
            uniformly structured honeycomb. This is the representation that the
            brand requires - ideating, creating and collaborating to come up
            with amazing work, every single time. Whether it’s just an
            individual looking for inspiration from publicly shared material so
            she or he can create something genius to groups coming together and
            tackling a big project, Honeycomb captures the concept of the brand.
          </p>
          <h3 class="h3-icon">

            <span>Logo Design</span>
          </h3>
          <p>
            Having decided the brand name, it was time to design a logo that
            would best represent Honeycomb as a cloud storage and organization
            service. I began this process by mind-mapping and sketching.
          </p>
          <div class="img-with-text">
            <p>
              To stay consistent with the honeycomb theme, I focused on infusing
              pentagons in my logo. This decision led to bringing four pentagons
              together to produce a bee which would be recognizable. All
              pentagons coming together to form a bee represents the process of
              working together to conjure an idea, create and execute.

          </h3>
          <img src="./images/ColorSwatches.png" alt="Color Swatches" />
          <p>
            Honeycomb’s identity is minimalist and playful yet trustworthy in
            the cloud storage market. To best represent this, I chose the
            following colors so that Honeycomb users would feel these
            characteristics while on the platform. I selected 2 shades of blue
            to reflect its trustworthiness but in shades that felt modern while
            the orange and muted pale pink was chosen to imbibe energy and used
            selectively throughout the platform.

          <p>
            Using my low-fidelity wireframes, I created the layout of
            Honeycomb’s interface focusing on the initial design decisions made
            and coupled it with feedback received through user testing.

          </h3>
          <p>
            But that’s not where the road ends - I put my iterations to test by
            creating several A/B tests on UsabilityHub. The following tests were
            created to identify which display of elements and design choices
            were most popular and favored to better refine Honeycomb’s design.

          <p>
            I applied the feedback received from preference tests to the design
            due since the users’ opinions are important and beneficial.

            <span>Clickable Prototype</span>
          </h3>
          <p>
            After receiving the results from my preference test, I went back to
            inVision to create a prototype and conducted 2 remote and 1
            in-person scenario-based usability test to better see the product’s
            usability and understand users’ opinions. After analyzing the data,
            I observed the following things:
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              All testers were able to conclude that Honeycomb is a cloud
              storage and collaborative platform
            </li>
            <li>The interface is straightforward and simple</li>
            <li>
              Publicly shared files feature is appealing to all participants
            </li>
            <li>
              Color scheme is professional, easy on the eyes and exudes
              trustworthiness
            </li>
            <li>
              There were no distractions or unnecessary clutter and Honeycomb
              has a very clean design
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            However, the following changes still had to be made based off the
            testers feedback:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              There were no distractions or unnecessary clutter and Honeycomb
              has a very clean design
            </li>
            <li>
              A “view all” option should be added to the dashboard: Testers
              stated that because there’s a scroll option, a “view all” option
              would make navigating the dashboard - and ultimately locating
              files, an easier task.
            </li>
            <li>
              The “share” button located in the document creator should be
              rounded: Testers noticed that this was the only button that still
              had sharp corners and recommended that the corners be rounded to
              maintain consistency across the platform.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            Making these changes to the design finally paved a way for Honeycomb
            to come to life.

          <p>
            Instead of going with my assumptions, I had to look to research in
            order to identify the goals of my target audience, the pain points
            they go through when trying to meet their goals and a solution that
            would hopefully eradicate their current pain points in their
            process.
          </p>
          <p><strong>Test, test, test and more tests!</strong></p>
          <p>
            User testing, whether it’s usability or preference tests hold the
            key to successfully refine the product. At the end of the day, it’s
            not about the client or the designer - the users are the core of the
            product. What better way is there but to continuously conduct tests
            to receive and gather feedback from users that would improve the
            product?

          <p><strong>Scope creep is scary and can happen anytime</strong></p>
          <p>
            Coming up with an MVP is harder to do and scope creep can happen at
            anytime when many features/processes are considered. That being
            said, the next time I’m on a project, I need to constantly remind
            myself that I should design less user flows early on in the process
            so I could spend more time focusing on testing and refining fewer
            primary flows to ensure that everything is optimal and the best it
            could be.

            I would love to create additional pages to make the prototype more
            realistic and exceptional for users. In addition to this, other key
            features that I would’ve considered to add would be to showcase the
            power of using the search field when looking at publicly shared
            files so that users would better understand how this could work as a
            resource for them as individuals and as a team.
